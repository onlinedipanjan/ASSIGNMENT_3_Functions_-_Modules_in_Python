## Task 1: Factorial Calculation

### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Example

If the function is called with `5`, the output should be:
